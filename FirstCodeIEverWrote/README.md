This folder contains the first code I ever wrote. I'm not sure everything is here, since it's been nearly a decade since I wrote it, but it contains code I've translated from the IDL programming language into Python, 
And also some data analysis and processing code I wrote for NASA's GENESIS mission under the supervision of Dr. Dan Reisenfeld during his and my time at the University of Montana. Don't expect to be able to run the code, as the data I used is govt property, and I no longer have access to it. Perhaps you'll see it in a publication one day.

Some notes here: 
1) The code naming scheme is ludacris. I had just finished some code tutorials via Canopy's tutorial offerings, and hadn't thought about version control
2) I had 'Beginner programmer syndrome', I tended towards initializing way too many variables, and individually populating those variables in my code more often than automatomically filling dict and list values, cause I was a noob.
3) I tended towards rewriting already written code when adding new/updated features to the code, cause I had only so many hours put into the practice, and I like programming, I guess....
4) modularity, general functions, etc. <- did not understand value
