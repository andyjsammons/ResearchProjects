This folder contains some R code, and some python code all with the goal of registering image pairs.... The image pairs constitute and RGB image, and a thermal image. Image Registration lays these two images atop each other via edge detection and matrix manipulation mechanisms.
The end result is the create a raster (layered image) ojbect containing values for RGB and thermal measures. Ultimately, this project sought to examine the thermal signature of Arrow leaf Balsom root plants, and insect populations among the leaves. The initial process of this
project included the mind-numbing task of feature labeling. Namely, I would outline the leaves in a python program, and save those as the features of interest. Google does this via their captcha challenges, e.g. 'Select all imgaes containing a bike'....
