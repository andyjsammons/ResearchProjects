# ResearchProjects
This repo contains mostly python, and some R code I've written doing paid research projects.

You'll see some of the first code I ever wrote. If I had time, and interest, there are a lot of things I'd go back and change/fix. Particularly, my version control is a bit out of wack. You'll notice the version names are pretty confusing. This is something I had been newly
introduced to, and at the time, I was keen to rewrite a lot of the code I had written on older versions. Not sure why, just like to code. Hopefully some of the newer projects demonstrate a maturity in my programming behavior and skill.
