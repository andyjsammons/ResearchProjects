This file contains some R code, and a tiny bit of Python code. I struggled getting RniftyReg to function inside an R script, so opted to use Pythons implementation, hence the python files. I can't recall what this code does, but the details of the project are this:
1) Register RGB images atop IR (infrared) images.
2) Create raster objects of these layered images
3) There was a point where I was doing feature selection via drawing outlines around leaves for probably around 100 images of arrow leaf balsam root images.
4) Never got this far, but wanted to run some ML on the raster objects to compare insect population to infrared values.
More than anything, I hope this code demonstrates that I can pick up a new language in a relatively short period of time and be effective with it after my time spent programming in Python.
